Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis conducted using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It demonstrates essential steps in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive actionable insights from a dataset.

Dataset
The analysis is based on the dataset goibibo_flights_data.csv, which contains information on flights, including parameters like flight routes, pricing, durations, and other key features. This dataset is loaded and analyzed using various Python libraries.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics, correlations, and trend analysis.

Data Visualization: Interactive and static visualizations to uncover insights.

Tools and Technologies
Python: Core programming language for data analysis.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for code execution and visualization.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: Numerical computing.

Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualization.

Steps to Reproduce
Clone the repository.

Ensure the dataset goibibo_flights_data.csv is placed in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

Install required libraries by running:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells sequentially.

Outputs
The notebook provides the following outputs:

Summary statistics of the dataset.

Visualizations showcasing trends and distributions.

Key insights from the data.

Insights Discovered
Patterns in flight pricing based on time and route.

Identification of popular routes and airlines.

Analysis of delays and other key factors affecting flight operations.

Future Enhancements
Integrate machine learning models for predictive analysis.

Expand the dataset to include additional features for a more comprehensive analysis.

Develop interactive dashboards for real-time data exploration.
